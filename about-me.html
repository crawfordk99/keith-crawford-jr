        <p>
            I'm currently enrolled at BYU-Idaho. I'm working on a Bachelor's Degree in Computer
            Science. This is a relatively new passion of mine, but I've been loving every second of it.
            I've already learned the basics of Java, Python, HTML, and CSS. I've dabbled in JavaScript,
            and REACT. I'm a quick, diligent, and willing learner who wants to learn and build 
            as many different and varietable computer skills as he can. As far as my hobbies go,
            I love spending time with family, playing video games, playing basketball, watching/reading a good
            story, and writing poetry.

        <p>
            A sports quiz that generates a "sports fandom level" based on how many multiple-choice answers
            you get correct. Used multiple functions, lists, and enumerated the answers. Created with Python.

        <a class="website" href="https://crawfordk99.github.io/tripplanner/index.html">Self-Made Website</a>
        <p>
            A website I created using my own personal business idea. Used HTML and CSS, with imported 
            JavaScript code to create a sticky nav bar. Includes Site Plan.
