            Hello, I'm currently enrolled at BYU-Idaho. I'm working on a Bachelor's Degree in Computer
            Science. This is a relatively new passion of mine, but I've been loving every second of it.
            I've already learned the basics of Java, Python, C#, HTML, and CSS. I've dabbled in JavaScript,
            and REACT. I'm a quick, diligent, and willing learner who wants to learn and build 
            as many different and varietable computer skills as he can. 
        </p>

            <p class="sports-p">
                A sports quiz that generates a "sports fandom level" based on how many multiple-choice answers
                you get correct. Used multiple functions, lists, and enumerated the answers. Created with Python.

            <p class="website-p">
                A website I created using my own personal business idea. Used HTML and CSS, with imported 
                JavaScript code to create a sticky nav bar. Includes Site Plan.

            <p class = "basketball-p">
                A program I created with 8 classes in C#. Shows the 4 principles of object-oriented programming in abstraction,
                encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Creates a dream profile, and saves shooting stats to file.
